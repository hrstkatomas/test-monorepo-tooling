## For local development on your machine install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime
```shell
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
note: This will install the latest version but make sure, your local version of Bun is `1.1.6` (currently there is no unified way to enforce this). You can install specific version as:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.1.6"
```
